# Project 7: Personal Diary Management System

The **Personal Diary Management System** is a console-based application developed in the C programming language as part of the coursework for **CSE115**.  

The project was designed to demonstrate practical knowledge of structured programming concepts, file handling, and modular program design in C.

## Project Overview

This program provides a menu-driven interface that enables users to create, manage, and organize diary entries. Each entry is stored in a file, allowing data to persist between program executions.  

The system supports the following core functionalities:

- **Add Entries** – Create and save new diary records with relevant details.  
- **View Entries** – Display all stored diary entries in a structured format.  
- **Search Entries** – Locate specific entries by providing the corresponding date.  
- **Edit Entries** – Modify the contents of an existing entry without creating a duplicate.  
- **Delete Entries** – Permanently remove an existing diary entry from the records.  
- **Backup Entries** – Create a backup copy of all diary records for safekeeping.  

These features ensure that users can maintain a well-organized and easily accessible personal diary.

## How to Run the Program

1. Open the project using a C compiler or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as **Code::Blocks**.  
2. Compile and execute the `main.c` file.  
3. Use the on-screen menu options to:  
   - Add new diary entries  
   - View existing records  
   - Search for specific entries  
   - Edit or delete entries  
   - Create a backup of the diary  

It is recommended to store all project files in a single directory to ensure proper file handling.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Compiler Compatibility:** Works with GCC and other standard C compilers  
- **Concepts Used:** Modular programming, file handling (read/write/append), loops, conditionals, and user-defined functions  
- **File Storage:** All diary data is stored in text files for persistence  

## Notes

- This program was developed as part of the **CSE115** academic coursework.  
- The implementation follows standard C conventions and does not rely on platform-specific libraries, ensuring portability.  
- The system is intended for **educational purposes only**.
